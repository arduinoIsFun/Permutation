# Permutation

This program will write all the permutations of a string into a file. Simply enter a string of reasonable small length (1-9) and it will print out all the arrangements of a string. Note: This program treats all characters as distinguishable. Therefore, there will be some repeated strings if the string contains at least two of the same character. If you want to write all of this into a folder, simply change the file path in line 34.
